# REGULAR EXPRESSION
A regular expression is a method used in programming for pattern matching. Regular expressions provide a flexible and concise means to match strings of text. For example, a regular expression could be used to search through large volumes of text and change all occurrences of "cat" to "dog".

Regular expressions are used for syntax highlighting systems, data validation and in search engines such as Google, to try to determine an algorithmic match to the query a user is asking.

Regular expressions are also known in short form as __regex__ or __regexp__.

There are many software applications and programming languages that support regular expressions. If you are a programmer, you can save yourself lots of time and effort. You can often accomplish with a single regular expression in one or a few lines of code what would otherwise take dozens or hundreds.

Many applications and programming languages have their own implementation of regular expressions, often with slight and sometimes with significant differences from other implementations. When two applications use a different implementation of regular expressions, we say that they use different "regular expression flavors". Unlike most other regex tutorials, the tutorial on this website covers all the popular regular expression flavors, and indicates the differences that you should watch out for.
