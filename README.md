#REGULAR EXPRESSION
A regular expression is a method used in programming for pattern matching. Regular expressions provide a flexible and concise means to match strings of text. For example, a regular expression could be used to search through large volumes of text and change all occurrences of "cat" to "dog".

Regular expressions are used for syntax highlighting systems, data validation and in search engines such as Google, to try to determine an algorithmic match to the query a user is asking.

Regular expressions are also known in short form as __regex__ or __regexp__.
